               <p>
                   My name is Jugveer Sandher I'm currently a grade 11 and BCIT Computing student. 
                </p>

               <p>
                   I grew up in west Abbotsford, BC in the middle of the of gang violence and drug turf war. I grew up in a traditional Sikh household and was raised by my neighbourhood. This carried its own positive and negative features as I will describe.
               </p>
               
                <p>
                    As I went into my 11th grade year I knew I was at a crossroad in my life and could choose a single path. At this time I felt I had limited option and had to pick the best of the worst. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I was lucky to have mentors who cared and gave me support. I was directed in the positive direction and was able to create my own path that helped me explore my interests.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    At this time I realized the importance of having strong role models. As my community is troubled by violence and drugs I sought out to be a leader for other young men who were in my predicament.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    I decided to be a part of leadership at WJ Mouat Secondary. At this same time we began to go through the first stages of the pandemic. This hinderance slowed down some of my growth as volunteer opportunities were hard to come across.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I found the positive in this as all universities went to online delivery. This allowed me to become a BCIT Computing student. This has improved my outreach as I am mastering the ways to use technology.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Using my technical skills I and a group of students I know have gotten together to build a Sikh Archives API and eventually database. We hope by documenting early Sikh immigrants we can help future children decades and centuries in the future feel a connection with their ancestors.
                </p>
                
                <p>This is something we decided to create as too often do we meet 5th, 6th, etc. Canadians who don't know about their roots. As we become a mixed community it would be great for us to not lose the sense of our forefathers and the values they contributed to our great country of Canada.
