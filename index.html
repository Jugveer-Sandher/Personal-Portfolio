               <p>My name is Jugveer Sandher I'm currently a grade 11 and BCIT Computing student. </p>

               <p>My goal for grade 11 and 12 is to be selected for the Hootsuite internships available for high school students. 
                   This will help me in my goal of becoming a leader in my community and chasing my passion for coding. I am hopeful 
                   this experience will aid me in my pursuit of enrollment in an Ivy League University. After graduation, I would prefer
                    a familiar environment and would want to return home. I am hoping with that experience and the internships I could be
                     a full-time engineer at Hootsuite.
               </p>
               
                <p>In my prior semester during the Fall of 2020, I completed Introduction to Python and Business Communications at BCIT. I obtained a final grade of 94% and 93%. This placed me in the top 90th percentile as a high school student amongst my university classmates. During that time I also earned a place in the top 95th percentile of my high school courses which consisted of English, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Pre-Calculus.
                </p>
                
                <p>For the upcoming Winter Semester of 2021, I have enrolled in two computing-related courses. This would include a 2nd-year University Java OOP and a Programming 11 course. I would complete these before the internship would begin. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I have also taken steps in my personal development by self-learning Java, learning Git/GitHub, using FreeCodeCamp (FCC), and working through The Odin Project (TOP). I would like to note than I took BCIT courses due to my self-interest. As many found the pandemic to be disadvantageous I used it to my benefit as it shifted to online delivery. This allowed me to fit it within my schedule without the additional commute time.
                </p>
                
                <p> I am confident that my drive, motivation, ability to work efficiently, and self-learn will show my mentor that I am capable and would have earned this opportunity.
